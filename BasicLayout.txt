1.Game Controller

The game controller acts like a central communication script for all of the differ-
ent parts of the game. In a way, it is the main glue that holds together the various

components that make up the game.
2. Scene Manager
This script deals with the loading and saving of scenes. Scenes are what Unity calls
its level files.
3. UI Manager
The UI manager draws all of the main in-game user interface elements, such as
score display and lives.
4. Sound Manager

The sound manager handles sound playback. The manager holds an array con-
taining the AudioClips of possible sounds to play.When the game first begins, the
sound manager creates one individual AudioSource per sound in the array. When
we need to play a sound, the index number referring to a sound’s place in the array
is passed to the manager. It uses the sound’s individual AudioSource to play the
source, which helps to alleviate problems that may be caused by playing too many
sound files from a single source.
5. Players
Players may already be present in the game scene or may be instantiated by the
game controller. 
6. AI and Enemies
As with players script, AI-controlled characters or enemies may already be present in
the scene at load time or they may be created at runtime by the game controller or
other script.
